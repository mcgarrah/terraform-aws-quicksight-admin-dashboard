This directory will contain the Lambda function code extracted from the CloudFormation templates.

The two main Lambda functions are:
1. data_prepare.py - For collecting QuickSight metadata
2. dataset_info.py - For processing dataset information

The Lambda code will need to be downloaded from the CloudFormation templates and adapted for use with Terraform.
